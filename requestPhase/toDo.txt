1. Add userIDPort support to requests.js
	- Need user to submit the port that they are listening on when they first make a request
	- Or implement socket.io emitting to specific user
	- Maintain mapping from ID to Port
2. Fetch user's IP address to use in receiveMsgFromServer
3. Figure out why it doesn't work on GTWifi
